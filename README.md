Also, how many hours are required to travel 410 miles?” The solution to this problem uses the well-known formula Here’s how this problem would be solved with a computer program: Private Sub btnCompute_Click(...) Handles btnCompute.Click  lstResults.Items.Add(3 / 2)  lstResults.Items.Add(3 ^ 2)  lstResults.Items.Add(2 * (3 + 4)) End Sub [Run, and then click on the button.] distance = speed × time elapsed
